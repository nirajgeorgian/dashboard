## Read me for the project coding pattern
### All the file names should begin with capital letters
### Inside component use functional component as much as you can
### Using react-redux, So don't use this.setState() let the react-redux take care of it.
### Always export all the module to one index file and import everything from the index file
### Don't use plain objects as actions use redux-actions to create actions as much as you can because they are implemented as flux standard actions creator
### Put all the assests inside assests folder within your own folder
